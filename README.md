# BTC-Tracker
This is a simple BTC tracker that web scrapes BTC prices each minute for the duration of the user input in minutes. 

Once the data has been collected, the program prints the mean, standard deviation, median, percent change, and variance of the price
over the given time.

Finally, the program creates a line graph of the price with the x-axis representing time in minute intervals, and the y-axis representing 
price.
